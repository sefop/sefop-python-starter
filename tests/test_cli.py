ROLE: Unit test for cli.main()'s default folder resolution.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
    tests/integration/test_situations.py already exercises cli.main() end-to-end
    across many optimization scenarios, but every one of those runs passes
    explicit --data-folder/--output-folder flags. That leaves one behavior
    untested: what happens when a caller omits both flags and cli.main() must
    fall back to Settings().folder_path / Settings().output_folder_path, which
    are relative paths ("data"/"output") resolved against the current working
    directory. This file covers exactly that fallback path so it isn't lost
    once the flag-based behavior is fully covered elsewhere.
