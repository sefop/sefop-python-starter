"""Configuration and composition root for the application.

This module has two jobs, kept together because they're two sides of the
same coin:

1. Hold every configurable value (the `Settings` dataclass) in one place,
   rather than scattered as literal strings across the codebase. A data
   scientist forking this repository to point at their own data or output
   folder only needs to edit `Settings` here.
2. Assemble the object graph the CLI needs (the `build_*` factory
   functions). This is the only module in the codebase allowed to import
   concrete adapters and construct concrete use cases directly. cli.py calls
   these factory functions instead of constructing anything itself, so every
   other module can depend on abstract ports (use_cases/ports/) without
   knowing which concrete adapter ultimately gets wired in.
